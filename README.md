DDS-Client-2 -- Project Bakesale
================================
Todo:
Note: This is a working todo list. Will add things as they come up
** All ** 
1. Relative Path imports in python and/or appending a parent directory to the path
	i.e. given the folder structure below, both client and server need 
	Message.py but preferably if only needed to have it in one place, a Classes folder

		DDS-Client-2
			-> Client
				-> main.py
			-> Server
				-> main.py
			-> Classes
				-> Message.py

** Display **
1. Python to webpage communication. Should be dynamic and a two way connection

2. Core Display cycling functionality (Display running through the slides)

** Server **
1. WP to Server communication (JSON parsing and then acting upon that information)

Moar functionality


DDS is a NU Crew project.
